Use a prediction method of your choosing (Kalman Filter, Weiner Filter, Fuzzy Logic, Neural
Networks, etc) to generate a prediction signal from an input signal given as a file found on
BlackBoard as ‘project1_part2.txt’. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE).! !
Output should be 1) a pdf file showing with single figure showing the overlay of the original
signal and the predicted signal. Include the MSE as an annotation within the figure, 2) a text file
named ‘project1_part2final.txt’ with the original signal as column 1, the predicted signal as
column 2 and the error signal as column 3.
