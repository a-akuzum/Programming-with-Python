Convolve two given signals (sin(?t)) and plot.! !!
Signal 1: ! Amplitude = 10!
! ! Frequency = 5Hz! !
Signal 2: ! Amplitude = 200!
! ! Frequency = 50Hz! !
Time: ! ! t = 0:0.001:1! !
Plot Directions: In one figure, use subplots to plot the following 3 signals, Signal 1, Signal 2 and
the signal resulting from convolution of Signals 1 & 2. Be sure to extract the middle of the
resulting convolution to force the final plot to be of the same length as Signals 1 & 2. Save
resulting plot as a PDF file.!
